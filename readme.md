# SteamOS Jupiter Repository

This is an automatically updated mirror of the SteamOS Jupiter repository built from the SteamOS source packages found [here](https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources). For more information, see the tool that generates this mirror, [evlav](https://github.com/evlav/evlav).

Currently, the only difference between this repository and the official sources is that the `PKGBUILD` URLs that direct to private Valve repositories have been replaced with repositories in this mirror.

> [!WARNING]
> This mirror is automatically generated from scratch and updated automatically. **It may have its history regenerated at any time.**
